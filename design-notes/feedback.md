### D, Solana Memecoin Trader
- Cares more about supporting price of his memecoin when it's particularly down vs the overall market, than supporting it/acquiring more tokens during broad market short term declines.
- PD is more useful and valuable on Solana than Ethereum chains.
- When the entire market declines, PD should detect that and change behavior to use SSL to bid a strong recovery, rather than try to limit the bottom's depth.
- Low-quality memecoin movements can be a leading indicator of crypto market overall being overheated, and can be used as an input to triggering different modes of PD.
